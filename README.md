Each Jupyter source file contains tasks and their solution codes in it

This project explores the art of data visualization using a relational database management system (RDBMS). The primary objectives are to:

## Visualize Distributions: 
Understand the spread of data within a single variable (e.g., histograms, box plots).
## Visualize Relationships: 
Explore connections between two variables (e.g., scatter plots, bubble plots).
## Visualize Composition: 
Analyze the makeup of categorical data (e.g., pie charts, stacked charts).
## Visualize Comparison: 
Compare data across different categories or timeframes (e.g., line charts, bar charts).

### Prerequisites
## Download the SQLite database file: 
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m4_survey_data.sqlite Â  
Setting Up

## Install the required Python libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Replace 'DB Path' with the actual path to your downloaded database file in the code examples.
